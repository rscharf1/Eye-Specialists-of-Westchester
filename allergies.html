        <p>Many people experience seasonal allergies. Airborne allergens, such as house dust, animal dander and mold constantly
        bombard the eyes and can cause ocular allergies at any time.<br><br>
        
        Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, or hay fever, is the most common allergic eye problem. Various antihistamine and
        decongestant eyedrops can soothe irritated eyes.<br><br>
        
        In order to alleviate symptoms, make every effort to avoid allergens. An allergist can help determine what you are
        allergic to so that you can stay away from it. Staying away from outdoor pollen may be impossible, but remaining
        indoors in the mornings when the outdoor pollen levels are highest may help control symptoms. If you are allergic to
        house dust, open windows and keep household air filters clean.<br><br>
        
        Cold compresses help to decrease swelling and itching. Artificial tears dilute the allergens and form a protective
        barrier over the surface of the eye. Avoid rubbing the eyes because it usually makes the symptoms worse.<br><br>
        
        If seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is a problem, Dr. Scharf or Dr. Cohen can prescribe one of several new safe and
        effective anti-allergy drops. They can also make sure symptoms are not being caused by a more serious problem.</p>
