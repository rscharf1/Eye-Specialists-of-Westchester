        <p>We accept Medicare and most insurance and HMO plans for which we perform electronic billing.</p>
        <p>We encourage you to discuss any financial concerns with our staff. We strongly believe that no one
        should be deprived of necessary medical care.</p><br>
        <h5>Insurance</h5>
        <p>Our office participates in Medicare and with most other insurance carriers. We accept assignment from most carriers.
        Please call (914) 235-9500 to find out if we participate with your insurance carrier. Please bring your current
        insurance card and photo identification to each visit. We request that you inform us of any changes in your coverage or
        address. We will make every effort to verify your insurance coverage prior to your appointment, yet we cannot guarantee
        coverage of services by your insurance company.</p><br>
        <h5>Benefits & Eligibility</h5>
        <p>To determine your insurance benefits and eligibility, please contact your insurance carrier directly. Note that you are
        ultimately responsible for payment of all services that are not covered by your insurance plan.</p><br>
        <h5>Out-Of-Pocket Expenses</h5>
        <p>Our office policy is to collect any co-payment that is predetermined by your insurance carrier at the time of service.
        Non-covered procedures may include, but are not limited to, refractions. A refraction may be performed to verify
        whether or not your vision can be improved with a new prescription. A refraction is considered routine by Medicare as
        well as most other insurance carriers. This charge will be passed along to you if your insurance carrier denies
        payment. Payment of co-insurance amounts and any annual deductible will be billed to you when we receive notification
        from your insurance carrier of these amounts.</p><br>
        <p>As a courtesy to our patients, we will bill all primary insurance carriers if we are a participating provider. If we
        are not a contracted provider, payment will be expected at the time of service.</p>
