        <h4 class="page-header">How to Insert Eyedrops</h4>
        <p>Infections, inflammation, glaucoma, and many other eye disorders are treated with eyedrops. Surprisingly, even the
        small amount of medicine in an eyedrop can create side effects in other parts of the body. There are ways to decrease
        the absorption of the eyedrop into the system, while making the medicine more effective in the eye at the same time.<br><br>
        
        Inserting eyedrops may seem difficult at first, but it becomes easier with practice. To put in an eyedrop, tilt the
        head back. Then create a pocket in front of the eye by pulling the lower lid down with an index finger or gently
        pinching the lower lid outward with the thumb and index finger. Let the drop fall into the lower eyelid pocket.<br><br>
        
        Immediately after instilling the eyedrop, gently squeeze the bridge of your nose near the corner of your eye for one
        minute with your thumb and forefinger. This prevents most of the drop from traveling down the tear duct to the rest of
        the body.<br><br>
        
        Keep your eyes closed for one minute after instilling the drop. Because the volume of a single drop exceeds the
        capacity of the surface of the eye, it serves no purpose to use more than one drop.<br><br>
        
        Before opening your eyes, dab unabsorbed drops and tears from the closed lids with a tissue.<br><br>
        
        If you are taking two or more different types of eyedrops, wait at least five minutes before instilling another
        medication.</p>
