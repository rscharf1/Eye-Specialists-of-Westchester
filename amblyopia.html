        <p>Amblyopia is an eye problem that causes poor vision in children. Often referred to as ‘lazy eye’, this vision problem
        is the leading cause of decreased vision in children. Amblyopia usually affects one eye but can reduce vision in both
        eyes. Problems begin when the pathways that carry vision messages from one of the eyes to the brain do not grow strong
        enough. The brain then favors the other eye, and vision does not develop normally. The brain and eyes must work
        together to produce clear vision. If the brain favors one eye, usually due to poor vision in the other eye, the weaker
        eye tends to wander inward or outward. Amblyopia is common in that it affects two or three out of every 100 people. The
        best time to correct amblyopia is during infancy or early childhood. After the first nine years of life, the visual
        system is normally fully developed and usually cannot be changed.</p>
        <h5>Causes</h5>
        <p>Amblyopia may be caused by any condition that affects normal visual development or use of the eyes. Amblyopia can be
        caused by strabismus, an imbalance or misalignment of the child’s eyes; extreme nearsightedness, farsightedness or
        astigmatism in one eye; droopy eyelid; and occasionally by a cataract. In these cases, one eye becomes stronger and
        suppresses the images of the other eye. The weaker eye may become useless if this persists.</p>
        <h5>Diagnosis</h5>
        <p>Unless the child has a misaligned eye or other obvious abnormality, there is often no way for parents to tell that
        their child has amblyopia. A child may not be aware of having one strong eye and one weak eye. Amblyopia is detected by
        finding a difference in vision between the two eyes or poor vision in both eyes. Dr. Scharf or Dr. Cohen will also
        carefully examine the interior of the eye to see if other eye diseases may be causing decreased vision, such as:
        cataracts, inflammation, tumors or other disorders of the inner eye.</p>
        <h5>Treatment</h5>
        <p>Early detection and treatment is the most effective way to save the vision in the affected eye. There are various
        treatments for amblyopia. Glasses or contact lenses will fix some problems. Surgery may be needed for cataracts, droopy
        eyelids or crossed eyes. The child will need to use the weaker eye most of the time so that it will get stronger. The
        most common and effective treatment for amblyopia is to cover or patch the eye with the normal vision. This can be done
        for all or part of the day for a period of time until the vision in the weaker eye matches that of the normal eye.<br><br>
        
        It is recommended that all children have their vision checked by their pediatrician, family physician, or
        ophthalmologist at or before their fourth birthday. Most physicians test vision as part of a child’s medical
        examination. They may refer a child to an ophthalmologist if there is any sign of eye problems.</p>
