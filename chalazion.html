        <p>A chalazion is a swelling of the eyelid caused by inflammation of one of the small oil producing glands located in the
        upper and lower eyelids. A chalazion is sometimes confused with a stye, which also appears as a swelling of the eyelid.
        Chalazions tend to occur farther from the edge of the eyelid than styes, and they tend to “point” towards the inside of
        the eyelid. Sometimes, a chalazion can cause the entire eyelid to swell.<br><br>
        
        When a chalazion is small and without symptoms, it may disappear on its own. If the chalazion is large, it may cause
        blurred vision. Chalazions are treated with any or a combination of the following methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Warm compresses can be applied. The simplest way is to hold a clean washcloth, soaked in hot water, against the closed
            eyelid. Do this for five to ten minutes, three or four times a day. Repeatedly soak the washcloth in hot water to
            maintain adequate heat. The majority of chalazions will disappear in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Oral doxycycline is sometimes used to treat large chalazions which have not been present for very long.</li>
            <li>Surgical excision may be used to remove large chalazions which do not respond to other treatments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Chalazions usually respond well to treatment, although some people are prone to recurrences. If a chalazion recurs in
        the same location, Dr. Scharf or Dr. Cohen may suggest a biopsy to rule out a more serious problem.</p>
