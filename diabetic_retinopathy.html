        <h4 class="page-header">Diabetic Retinopathy</h4>
        <p>Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that results from damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive
        tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). It is possible to have diabetic retinopathy and not know it, as you may not
        experience any symptoms in the early stages. As diabetic retinopathy progresses, it can result in blindness.<br><br>
        
        Anyone who has type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes is at risk for diabetic retinopathy. The longer you have diabetes,
        and the less controlled your blood sugar is, the more likely you are to develop diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic patients
        should take prevention of diabetic retinopathy very seriously by carefully controlling their blood sugar level and
        having regular eye examinations.</p>
        <h5>Symptoms</h5>
        <p>Since it is uncommon to experience symptoms in the early stages of diabetic retinopathy, patients may be unaware that
        they have the disease. Diabetic retinopathy usually affects both eyes. As the condition progresses, diabetic
        retinopathy symptoms may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spots or dark strings floating in your vision (also known as floaters)</li>
            <li>Blurred vision</li>
            <li>Fluctuating vision</li>
            <li>Dark or empty areas in your vision</li>
            <li>Poor night vision</li>
            <li>Impaired color vision</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Risk Factors</h5>
        <p>Anyone can develop diabetic retinopathy, but the risk is greater if you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have poor control of your blood sugar level</li>
            <li>Have high blood pressure</li>
            <li>Have high cholesterol</li>
            <li>Are pregnant</li>
            <li>Are black or Hispanic</li>
            <li>Smoke</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The longer you have diabetes, the greater your risk is of developing diabetic retinopathy. Careful management of your
        diabetes is the best way to prevent diabetic retinopathy. Because it is important to detect diabetic retinopathy in the
        early stages, if you have diabetes, see your ophthalmologist yearly for a dilated eye examination. This is extremely
        important even if you have no symptoms and your vision seems fine. If you become pregnant, your ophthalmologist may
        recommend additional eye examinations throughout your pregnancy, because pregnancy can sometimes increase the risk of
        and worsen diabetic retinopathy.</p>
