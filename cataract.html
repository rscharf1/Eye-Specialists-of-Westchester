        <p>A cataract is a loss of transparency, or clouding, of the normally clear lens of the eye. As one ages, chemical changes
        occur in the lens that make it less transparent. The loss of transparency may be so mild that vision is hardly affected
        or so severe that no shapes or movements are seen. When the lens gets cloudy enough to obstruct vision to any
        significant degree, it is called a cataract. Other symptoms of cataracts include: glare or light sensitivity; poor
        night vision; double vision in one eye; required brighter light for reading; and fading or yellowing of colors. Glasses
        or contact lenses cannot sharpen your vision if a cataract is present.</p><br>
        <h5>Causes</h5>
        <p>The most common cause of a cataract is aging. Other causes include trauma, medications such as steroids, systemic
        diseases such as diabetes, previous eye surgery and prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light.
        Reducing the amount of ultraviolet light exposure by wearing a wide-brim hat and sunglasses may reduce your risk for
        developing a cataract. Once developed, there is no cure except to have the cataract surgically removed.
        How quickly the cataract develops varies among individuals and may even be different between two eyes. Most age-related
        cataracts progress gradually over a period of years. Other cataracts, especially in younger people and in people with
        diabetes, may progress rapidly over a short time. It is not possible to predict how fast cataracts will develop in any
        given person.</p><br>
        <h5>Treatment</h5>
        <p>Surgery is the only way that a cataract can be removed. However, if symptoms of cataract are not bothering you very
        much, surgery may not be needed. Sometimes a simple change in your eyeglass prescription may be helpful. No
        medications, dietary supplements or exercises have been shown to prevent or cure cataracts.
        Dr. Scharf has performed thousands of cataract surgeries. Small incision, no-stitch cataract surgery provides patients
        with a rapid recovery and early visual rehabilitation. In most cases, eyedrops are used to provide a painless method of
        anesthesia for cataract surgery. With this type of procedure, no eye patch is necessary, and the patient can see
        immediately after surgery. The time to have the surgical procedure is when your vision is bad enough that it interferes
        with your lifestyle.
        Cataract surgery is a very successful operation. One and a half million people have this procedure performed every
        year.</p>
