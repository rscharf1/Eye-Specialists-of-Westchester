        <h4 class="page-header">Lid Margin Disease</h4>
        <p>Lid margin disease is a common, persistent inflammation of the eyelids. Symptoms include irritation, itching, and
        occasionally, a red eye. This condition frequently occurs in people who have a tendency towards oily skin, dandruff, or
        dry eyes.<br><br>

        Bacteria normally reside on the skin, but in some people they thrive on the skin at the base of the eyelashes. Nearby
        oil glands may be overactive, causing dandruff-like scales and particles to form along the lashes and eyelid margins.
        This can cause redness, stinging or burning.</p>
        <p>Lid margin disease may not be cured, but it can be controlled with a few simple daily hygienic measures.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>At least twice a day, place a warm, wet washcloth over the closed eyelids for a few minutes. Rewet the washcloth as it
            cools. This will soften and loosen scales and debris. More importantly, it helps to liquefy the oily secretions from
            the eyelidsâ€™ oil glands.</li>
            <li>With your finger covered with a washcloth, cotton swab, or commercial lint-free pad, gently scrub the base of the
            lashes for about fifteen seconds per eyelid.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When medications are necessary, they may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Artificial tears</li>
            <li>Antibiotics (oral or topical) to decrease bacteria on the eyelids</li>
            <li>Occasionally, steroid eyedrops to decrease inflammation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Medications alone are not sufficient; the application of warmth and cleansing of the eyelashes daily is the key to controlling lid margin disease.</p>
